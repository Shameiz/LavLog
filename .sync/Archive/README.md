# LavLog
Ok so it's called the LavLog. It's meant to be used to people who work desk jobs, or use computers a lot for their work, etc. Basically what you do is clock out when you have to go to the bathroom, and clock back in when you come back. And It tells you how much money you make going to the bathroom at work. There will also be different stats like average trip to the bathroom, longest trip to the bathroom, best earning week, current week total, all time total, etc. And then there will also be a social aspect to it, where you can form groups with coworkers or friends and have leaderboards for all the different stats. And everyone will have their own profile and maybe you can add friends idk.
